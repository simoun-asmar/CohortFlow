# Cohort Analysis with BigQuery, Fivetran & Databricks

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the full data pipeline from data upload to actionable cohort analysis using modern data tools. The goal is to simulate a real-world business use case where we analyze **customer retention and repeat purchasing behavior** over time.

By integrating **Google BigQuery**, **Fivetran**, and **Databricks**, we:

- Ingest and prepare raw e-commerce data.
- Automate and schedule data syncing between platforms.
- Perform cohort-based SQL analysis to track customer behavior.
- Visualize insights through Databricks dashboards.

##  Project Objectives

- Understand **how customer cohorts perform** over time.
- Measure **retention rates** and **repeat purchase behavior** for each monthly cohort.
- Identify trends that can help improve marketing and customer retention strategies.

##  Tech Stack

- **Google BigQuery** â€“ for data warehousing.
- **Fivetran** â€“ for automated and secure data syncing.
- **Databricks** â€“ for advanced SQL analysis and visualization.
- **Markdown** â€“ for clear documentation of the workflow.
